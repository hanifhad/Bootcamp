This assignment was my first ever assignment in Python. 

Specifically we were given 2 sets of data and asked to used what we had learned in class (Dictionaries/Lists) along side research to determine what key asks.

In the PyPoll assignment we were asked to design a script that could give us:
  1. The Total Number of votes
  2. The list of all candidates
  3. The percentage of votes
  4. The winner of the election

In the PyBank assignment were were asked to design a script that could give us the:
  1. Total Number of Months
  2. The Total Profit
  3. The Average Change
  4. The Greatest Increase
  5. The Greatest Decrease
