This is the first assignment for the BCS Data Analytics Bootcamp (commenced in September, 2020).

Synopsis

The initial assignment was focused on cleaning up a database with ~4,000 Kickstarter projects and identifying possible trends/patterns.

Step 1 | Formatting
-	The first step was to apply conditional formatting to identify the status of each project by different colours.
-	 The following steps were to generate new columns and determine the percentage funded of all projects, the average donation separating category from sub-category.

Step 2 | Visualizing
-	The second step designing dashboards (consisting of a pivot chart and table) of key information to better understand what trends can be evaluated.

Step 3 | Conducting further statistical analysis
-	From this we then started to look at statistical results such as the standard deviation, variance, mean, median, mode, etc. to see if we could further understand what the data is telling us.
